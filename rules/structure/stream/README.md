# rules/structure/article/stream

## Description

This article contains information how to manage streams

## Problem

We can't store all articles without hierarchy, just in one sheet, because it's unreadable. So we need structure this knowledge base.

## Solution

Solution for that is a `stream`. The stream is like a folder, it groups other streams and articles.

### How to name stream

If you think about name for a new stream just follow simple rules:

* move from general to specific
* name should present domain or technology

### How to create index

Index should contains some headings

#### Header

Put path to stream there as h1 header(#) and clarify which topics your stream should cover

#### Glossary

If you plan to add an article with some not famous term put there this term and explanation.

Put your terms into a table.

#### Streams

Put there substreams with descriptions and links. Every stream is written as h3 header(###)

#### Articles

Put there articles of this stream with descriptions and links. Every action is written as h3 header(###)

## Restrictions

* Use only common words
* Name's length should be less than 5 words
* Don't create stream without articles or substreams

## Assumptions

No assumptions

## Advices

You can use [template](template.md) for index
